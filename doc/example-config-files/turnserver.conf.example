# TURN listener port for TLS (Default: 5349).
# Note: actually, "plain" TCP & UDP sessions can connect to the TLS & DTLS
# port(s), too - if allowed by configuration. The TURN server 
# "automatically" recognizes the type of traffic. Actually, two listening
# endpoints (the "plain" one and the "tls" one) are equivalent in terms of
# functionality; but we keep both endpoints to satisfy the RFC 5766 specs.
# For secure TCP connections, we currently support SSL version 3 and 
# TLS version 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. SSL2 "encapculation mode" is also supported.
# For secure UDP connections, we support DTLS version 1.

# This is needed for RFC 5780 support

# Auxiliary STUN/TURN server listening endpoint.
# Aux servers have almost full TURN and STUN functionality.
# The (minor) limitations are:

# 1) Auxiliary servers do not have alternative ports and

#
# 2) Auxiliary servers also are never returning ALTERNATIVE-SERVER reply.
# 
# Valid formats are 1.2.3.4:5555 for IPv4 and [1:2::3:4]:5555 for IPv6.

# Multiple relay addresses may be used.
# The same IP(s) can be used as both listening IP(s) and relay IP(s).
#
# If no relay IP(s) specified, then the turnserver will apply the default
# policy: it will decide itself which relay addresses to be used, and it 
# will always be using the client socket IP address as the relay IP address
# of the TURN session (if the requested relay address family is the same
# as the family of the client socket).

# For Amazon EC2 users:
#
# TURN Server public/private address mapping, if the server is behind NAT.
# In that situation, if a -X is used in form "-X <ip>" then that ip will be reported
# as relay IP address of all allocations. This scenario works only in a simple case
# when one single relay address is be used, and no RFC5780 functionality is required.
# That single relay address must be mapped by NAT to the 'external' IP.
# The "external-ip" value, if not empty, is returned in XOR-RELAYED-ADDRESS field.
# For that 'external' IP, NAT must forward ports directly (relayed port 12345
# must be always mapped to the same 'external' port 12345).
#
# In more complex case when more than one IP address is involved,
# that option must be used several times, each entry must
# have form "-X <public-ip/private-ip>", to map all involved addresses.
# RFC5780 NAT discovery STUN functionality will work correctly,
# if the addresses are mapped properly, even when the TURN server itself 
# is behind A NAT.
#
# By default, this value is empty, and no address mapping is used.

# TURN REST API flag.
# Flag that sets a special authorization option that is based upon authentication secret.
# This feature can be used with the long-term authentication mechanism, only.
# This feature purpose is to support "TURN Server REST API", see
# "TURN REST API" link in the project's page 
# http://code.google.com/p/rfc5766-turn-server/.
#
# This option is used with timestamp:
# 
# usercombo -> "timestamp:userid"
# turn user -> usercombo
# turn password -> base64(hmac(secret key, usercombo))
#
# This allows TURN credentials to be accounted for a specific user id.
# If you don't have a suitable id, the timestamp alone can be used.
# This option is just turning on secret-based authentication.
# The actual value of the secret is defined either by option static-auth-secret,
# or can be found in the turn_secret table in the database (see below).
# 
use-auth-secret

# 'Static' authentication secret value (a string) for TURN REST API only. 
# If not set, then the turn server
# will try to use the 'dynamic' value in turn_secret table
# in user database (if present). The database-stored  value can be changed on-the-fly
# by a separate program, so this is why that other mode is 'dynamic'.

# 'Static' user accounts for long term credentials mechanism, only.
# This option cannot be used with TURN REST API or with short-term credentials

#
#user=username1:key1

# OR:

#
# Keys must be generated by turnadmin utility. The key value depends
# on user name, realm, and password:
#
# Example:
# $ turnadmin -k -u ninefingers -r north.gov -p youhavetoberealistic
# Output: 0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# ('0x' in the beginning of the key is what differentiates the key from
# password. If it has 0x then it is a key, otherwise it is a password).
#
# The corresponding user account entry in the config file will be:
# 
#user=ninefingers:0xbc807ee29df3c9ffa736523fb2c4e8ee
# Or, equivalently, with open clear password (less secure):

# Option to set the "redirection" mode. The value of this option
# will be the address of the alternate server for UDP & TCP service in form of 
# <ip>[:<port>]. The server will send this value in the attribute
# ALTERNATE-SERVER, with error 300, on ALLOCATE request, to the client.
# Client will receive only values with the same address family
# as the client network endpoint address family. 
# See RFC 5389 and RFC 5766 for ALTERNATE-SERVER functionality description. 
# The client must use the obtained value for subsequent TURN communications.
# If more than one --alternate-server options are provided, then the functionality
# can be more accurately described as "load-balancing" than a mere "redirection". 
# If the port number is omitted, then the default port 
# number 3478 for the UDP/TCP protocols will be used.
# Colon (:) characters in IPv6 addresses may conflict with the syntax of 
# the option. To alleviate this conflict, literal IPv6 addresses are enclosed 
# in square brackets in such resource identifiers, for example: 
# [2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348]:3478 . 
# Multiple alternate servers can be set. They will be used in the
# round-robin manner. All servers in the pool are considered of equal weight and 
# the load will be distributed equally. For example, if we have 4 alternate servers, 
# then each server will receive 25% of ALLOCATE requests. A alternate TURN server 
# address can be used more than one time with the alternate-server option, so this 
# can emulate "weighting" of the servers.
#
# Examples: 
#alternate-server=1.2.3.4:5678
#alternate-server=11.22.33.44:56789
#alternate-server=5.6.7.8

# Option to set alternative server for TLS & DTLS services in form of 
# <ip>:<port>. If the port number is omitted, then the default port
