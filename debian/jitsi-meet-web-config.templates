_Description: SSL certificate
 .
 Jitsi Meet requires an SSL certificate. This installer can generate one automatically for your using "Letâ€™s Encrypt". This is the recommended and simplest option for most installations.
 .
 In the event you need to use a certificate of your own, you can configure its location which defaults to /etc/ssl/--domain.name--.key for the key and /etc/ssl/--domain.name--.crt for the certificate.
 .
 If you are a developer and are only looking for a quick way to test basic Jitsi Meet functionality then this installer can also generate a self-signed certificate.
