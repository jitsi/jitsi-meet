## Synching our fork with the Jitsi origin

If we want to include new Jitsi features in our fork, we need to rebase the jitsi origin branch on to our `master` branch.

Find the latest Jitsi release here: https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/releases

The release should be tagged. e.g. `stable/jitsi-meet_7882`

You should rebase this branch on to our `master` branch.
